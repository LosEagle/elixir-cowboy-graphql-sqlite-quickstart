# elixir-graphql-sqlite-quickstart
I wanted to get into coding Elixir apps that can communicate with frontend via GraphQL and are easy to self-host, so I've made this quickstart repo for GraphQL, SQLite and cowboy_plug stack on top of Elixir. It ain't much, but it's honest work :)   
Contributions are welcome and much appreciated.
